### Flask Python Docker Application

This repository demonstrates a **Flask-based Python application** containerized using **Docker** for streamlined development and deployment.

### Purpose

The goal of this project is to showcase the development of a scalable and portable Flask Python application leveraging the power of Docker containers. This setup ensures consistent environments during development, testing, and production.

### Key Features

- **Flask Framework**: A lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
- **Docker Containerization**: Encapsulates the application and its dependencies to run in isolated environments.
- **Portability**: Ensures the application can run seamlessly across different systems with Docker installed.
- **Simplified Deployment**: Reduces complexity by providing a single deployable Docker image.

### Project Workflow

1. **Develop Flask Application**: Build and test the Python-based Flask app.
2. **Create Docker Image**: Define the environment and dependencies using a `Dockerfile`.
3. **Run Docker Container**: Launch the Flask application using Docker.
4. **Deploy**: Deploy the container to any Docker-compatible environment.

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** installed locally.
- **Docker** installed on your system.
- Basic understanding of Flask and Docker.

### How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mewadaajay902/Flask-Python-Docker-App.git
   cd Flask-Python-Docker-App
   ```

2. Build the Docker image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t flask-python-docker-app .
   ```

3. Run the Docker container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-python-docker-app
   ```

4. Access the application:
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

### Why This Project Matters

This repository highlights your capability to develop and deploy containerized Python applications using Flask and Docker. It demonstrates your understanding of modern development practices, containerization, and application scalabilityâ€”essential skills in today's software engineering landscape.
